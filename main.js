        content: "According to historian H. Otley Beyer, the first inhabitants of the Philippine islands were the Dawnmen, often described as cavemen. Living about 250,000 years ago, they resembled the Java Man and Peking Man and survived through hunting and fishing, with no knowledge of agriculture. In search of food, they crossed land bridges that once connected the Philippines to Indonesia and later left for destinations unknown. It is fascinating to imagine these early humans moving across landscapes that would one day become islands shaped by history.",

        content: "About 30,000 years ago, the Aetas, also known as Negritos, crossed land bridges from Malaya, Borneo, and Australia, eventually reaching Palawan, Mindoro, and Mindanao. Skilled hunters and gatherers, they relied on spears and stone tools to survive. When the Ice Age ended and sea levels rose, the land bridges disappeared, forcing them to remain in the islands as the first permanent inhabitants. Their story reminds us how powerful natural changes can shape human settlement.",

        content: "With the disappearance of land bridges, the next wave of migrants, the Indonesians, arrived by sea. Skilled in seafaring, they were more technologically advanced than earlier groups. They used tools made of stone and steel, built sturdier houses, engaged in farming and mining, worked with brass, and wore clothing and body ornaments. Their arrival highlights how maritime skills became essential in shaping island societies.",

Dated to around 21,000 to 22,000 years ago, the remains known as Tabon Man show that humans lived in the Philippine islands far earlier than once believed. Anthropologist Felipe Landa Jocano used this evidence to support his Evolution Theory, suggesting a long process of regional evolution and migration. These discoveries continue to reshape how we understand the deep past of the Philippines.",

Because the land was low and swampy, early communities settled close to the water, turning the river into a vital lifeline. Lamayan became a busy trading hub, or entrepot, connecting many settlements around Laguna de Bay. Long before colonial walls were built, rivers already shaped the city’s importance.",
